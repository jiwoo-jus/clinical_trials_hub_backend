# CONTEXT #
You are tasked with analyzing clinical trial study reports or papers to extract specific information as structured data. Omit any fields if the corresponding data does not exist in the target articles. Do not invent or assume information that is not present in the given content.
# PAPER CONTENT #
{{pmc_text}}

# TARGET #
Extract the outcomesModule of the study. It dsscribes the primary, secondary, and other outcome measures, showing which indicators are used to assess the trialâ€™s effectiveness and safety.
# RESPONSE #
The JSON response must adhere to the following structure, where each field is annotated with its expected type.
Ensure that the output is a valid and correctly formatted JSON string.
Format:
```json
